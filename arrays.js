//Jon, embarrassed, intends to head back to Winterfell asap. First, let's create a backpack for him so he can begin to pack his bags. Create a variable called backpack, that is equal to an empty array.

let backpack = []

//Now, let's add some of his stuff to that backpack. Add 3 strings to the array, "sword", "shield", and "food".

backpack.push('sword', 'shield', 'food')

console.log(backpack)
